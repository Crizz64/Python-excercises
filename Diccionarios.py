#Dictionaries are collection types used to store data in key:value pairs, 
# which are considered as items. They are ideal for organizing data into pairs, 
# where each piece of data (value) has its unique identifier (key).

#For example


car = {
  "brand": "Audi",
  "model": "Q5",
  "year": "2008"
}

print(car["brand"])
print(car["model"])
print(car["year"])
