#Class methods are called on the class itself, 
# not on individual instances. This allows their use without needing to create a class instance. 
# They are especially useful for actions relevant to the class as a whole, 
# rather than actions limited to a single object. Here's an example:


class Book:
  def __init__(self, title, author):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author

  #regular method
  def describe_book(self):
    print(self.title, 'by', self.author)

  #class method
  @classmethod
  def books_in_series(cls, series_name, number_of_books):
    print('There are', number_of_books, 'books in the', series_name, 'series')

# Creating an instance of Book
my_book = Book("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "J.K. Rowling")

# Using the instance method to describe the book
my_book.describe_book()

# Using the class method to display information about the series
Book.books_in_series("Harry Potter", 7)



#ejercicio 2

#To call a class method you don't need to create an 
# instance of the class. Instead, just use the class name, 
# followed by a dot and the class method name.

class Book:
  def __init__(self, title, author):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author

  #regular method
  def describe_book(self):
    print(self.title, 'by', self.author)

  #class method
  @classmethod
  def books_in_series(cls, series_name, number_of_books):
    print('There are', number_of_books, 'books in the', series_name, 'series')

# Creating an instance of Book
my_book = Book("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "J.K. Rowling")

# Using the instance method to describe the book
my_book.describe_book()

# Using the class method to display information about the series
Book.books_in_series("Harry Potter", 7)



#ejercicio 3

#Instances share everything that a class has, 
# including the class methods. 
# This means that you call a class method on instances as well.

class Book:
  def __init__(self, title, author):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author

  #regular method
  def describe_book(self):
    print(self.title, 'by', self.author)

  #class method
  @classmethod
  def books_in_series(cls, series_name, number_of_books):
    print('There are', number_of_books, 'books in the', series_name, 'series')

# Creating an instance of Book
my_book = Book("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "J.K. Rowling")

# Using the instance method to describe the book
my_book.describe_book()

# calling the class method on the instance
my_book.books_in_series("Harry Potter", 7)



#ejercicio 4
#Static methods are similar to class methods, 
# except they don't receive any additional arguments; 
# they are identical to normal functions that belong to a class.

#They are marked with the @staticmethod decorator.


class Book:
  def __init__(self, title, author):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author

  #regular method
  def describe_book(self):
    print(self.title, 'by', self.author)

  #staticmethod
  @staticmethod
  def books_in_series(series_name, number_of_books):
    print('There are', number_of_books, 'books in the', series_name, 'series')

# Creating an instance of Book
my_book = Book("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "J.K. Rowling")

# Using the instance method to describe the book
my_book.describe_book()

# calling the static method
Book.books_in_series("Harry Potter", 7)
